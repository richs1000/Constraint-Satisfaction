Constraint-Satisfaction
=======================

Constraint satisfaction code for my Intro to AI course

This code implements
* backtracking search with forward checking, arc consistency and variable ordering
* hill-climbing with simulated annealing
* genetic algorithm

I also include samples that use the code to solve:
* N-Queens
* Map Coloring
* Choosing a schedule for NFL football games
